# the bypassi project
this project aims to make everything unblocked for people using blocksi on school chromebooks, and to have tons of games and proxies for people to use.

<!--
## devs
- this is being made by the people behind bypassrr, an old unblocking site.
- - -
## why this is useful
- we will have a custom chat app and full environment once we finish, but we have our old bypassrr ui for now, as we are working on the new ui.
